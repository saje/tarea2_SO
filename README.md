 ~~~
 This will create a folder with all the classes and create a jar file called tarea.jar

 Then to run the program:
 ~~~
 make run
 ~~~
 If you encounter any problems you can clean the project with:

## Problem 1
First parse then see how to use the thread.

## Problema 2: Divide and conquer
The idea is to do a merge sort but using threads. Whenever you divide the array use a thread to solve the sub-array.
